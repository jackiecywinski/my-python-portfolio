# This is a collection of my coding work throughout the year.

#SEMESTER 1:

#Project 1: Color Generator - This is a "name generator" style game that allows the player to select answers to this or that questions that will determine what color matches their personality. 


#Project 2: Powerpuff Girls - This is a drawing I coded with Grace and Jasmine that shows the 3 powerfpuff girls flying. We recreated an image we found online.


#Project 3: Pokemon Game - This is a game I coded that allows the user to level up their Pokemon character through battles and training. When they decide to rest, their stats such as wins, losses, day, and level are shown on their screen.


#Project 4: Frog - This is a drawing of a frog Jasmine and I coded together.


#Project 5: Underwater Scene - This is a drawing of fish, urchins, and seaweed (an underwater scene) that me, Jasmine, and Grace coded together.


#SEMESTER 2:

#Project 6: My Create Task - This is the code I submitted for the AP test. This code contains a procedure that recommends an activity to its user based on if they want to be indoor or outdoor. It includes iteration, sequencing, and selection.


#Project 7: Images - This project is a game that recommends a vacation location to its user. It does so by providing an image of the vacation destination with a description of the place. I learned to cite images by developing this program.
